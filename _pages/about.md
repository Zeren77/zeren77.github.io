I am an MPhil student in DSA Thrust of the Information Hub at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) advised by Prof. [Xinlei He](https://xinleihe.github.io).

My research interest focuses on AI Safety and Privacy, aiming to integrate real-world attack and defense practices for understanding and mitigating emerging threats in AI.
